# BubuDudu Development Log

## 2026-09-07

### Completed

- Created the BubuDudu Git repository
- Defined system requirements
- Defined high-level system architecture
- Defined required hardware interfaces
- Identified ESP32-C3 GPIO constraints
- Created an initial theoretical GPIO assignment
- Created a dedicated `design/pin-map` branch for pin-map development

### Current Working State

The project is currently in the hardware architecture and pin-planning phase.

No final GPIO assignment has been hardware validated yet.

### Next Step

Validate the theoretical pin map against the actual BubuDudu hardware modules and revise assignments where necessary.

### Completed

- Installed and configured PlatformIO in VS Code
- Restructured the project so the Git repository root is also the PlatformIO project root
- Configured the ESP32-C3 Super Mini using the `esp32-c3-devkitm-1` PlatformIO board profile
- Enabled native USB CDC communication at 115200 baud
- Successfully built, uploaded, and monitored firmware on the real ESP32-C3 Super Mini
- Created separate `bubu` and `dudu` PlatformIO build environments using one shared source tree
- Added compile-time device identity using `DEVICE_BUBU` and `DEVICE_DUDU`
- Added `include/Config.h` to expose the selected device identity to the firmware
- Verified that the same `src/main.cpp` builds and runs correctly as both Bubu and Dudu
- Created a dedicated `build/platformio` branch from `main`
- Moved the PlatformIO work away from `design/pin-map` without mixing branch histories
- Committed and pushed the PlatformIO firmware foundation to GitHub

### Current Working State

The project now has a working shared PlatformIO firmware foundation.

Bubu and Dudu use the same firmware source code but can be built with different compile-time identities.

The ESP32-C3 Super Mini has been hardware validated for building, uploading, automatic reset, native USB, and Serial Monitor communication using the current PlatformIO configuration.

The theoretical GPIO pin map remains separate on the `design/pin-map` branch and has not yet been fully hardware validated.

### Next Step

Continue hardware validation of the theoretical pin map, starting with the ESP32-C3 GPIO constraints and the GY-291 ADXL345 interface and wake-interrupt requirements.

### Completed

* Improved the dual-device PlatformIO workflow for working with Bubu and Dudu at the same time

* Identified the permanent Wi-Fi MAC address of each ESP32-C3 Super Mini

* Confirmed the physical device identities:

  * Bubu: `E8:F6:0A:12:4C:A4`
  * Dudu: `E8:F6:0A:12:5B:84`

* Confirmed the current USB serial-port mapping for both connected boards

* Created a new `tools/` directory for project development utilities

* Added `tools/flash_device.py`

* Implemented automatic device detection by reading the connected ESP32-C3 MAC addresses

* Added logic that determines whether a connected board is Bubu or Dudu based on its MAC address

* Integrated the Python flashing script into the PlatformIO development workflow

* Verified that both ESP32-C3 boards can remain connected simultaneously while the flashing tool automatically identifies the correct physical device

* Verified automatic flashing of the correct Bubu or Dudu PlatformIO environment without manually selecting the board by USB port

### Current Working State

The project now has a working automated dual-board development workflow.

Bubu and Dudu can both be connected to the computer simultaneously, and the tooling can identify each physical ESP32-C3 by its permanent MAC address instead of relying on changing USB serial-port names.

The `tools/flash_device.py` utility is integrated into the PlatformIO workflow and can select the appropriate Bubu or Dudu firmware environment for the detected board.

This keeps the project on one shared firmware codebase while allowing reliable development and flashing of the two physical devices independently.

### Next Step

Begin the physical hardware assembly and bring-up phase by starting from the known-working ESP32-C3 PlatformIO foundation and adding hardware modules one at a time, beginning with the basic input stage before moving to the GY-291 ADXL345.
